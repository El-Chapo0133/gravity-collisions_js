# gravity-collisions_js
Simple app that simulate gravity over multiple objects

## This is a side project
At first, this was only a project to test collisions
made from this website : https://spicyyoghurt.com/tutorials/html5-javascript-game-development/collision-detection-physics

then i implemented some functions for gravity (only one gravity for every objects, they do not attract each other).

then i implemented functions to attract them each other, no more one gravity for every objects.
